  "judgment": "ANALYSIS:\nAll three solutions correctly prove the irrationality of the square root of 2 using proof by contradiction. They all start by assuming the opposite, expressing the square root of 2 as a fraction a/b (or p/q), simplifying to lowest terms, and then deriving a contradiction by showing that both a and b (or p and q) must be even, thus sharing a common factor of 2.\n\nSolver 1 is clear and logically sound. It explicitly states each step and the reasoning behind it.\nSolver 2 is also well-structured and includes formal definitions and the use of \"reduced form,\" making the proof more rigorous. It also explicitly mentions the domain of real numbers.\nSolver 3 is similar to Solver 2, incorporating formal quantifiers and using \"coprime\" notation. It also condenses some steps for conciseness.\n\nThe main differences lie in the level of formality and conciseness. Solver 2 and 3 are slightly more formal due to the explicit definitions and notation. Solver 3 is also slightly more concise by combining some steps.\n\nWINNER: Solver 3\n\nREASONING:\nSolver 3 is the best solution because it strikes a good balance between rigor and conciseness. It incorporates formal notation (gcd(p, q) = 1) and explicitly states the assumptions and deductions, making the proof clear and easy to follow. It also avoids unnecessary verbosity by combining some steps, resulting in a more streamlined proof. While Solver 2 is also very good, Solver 3's conciseness gives it a slight edge. Solver 1 is also correct, but less formal than Solvers 2 and 3.\n\nCONFIDENCE: 1\n\nFINAL_ANSWER:\nAssume √2 is rational. Then there exist integers p and q, q ≠ 0, such that √2 = p/q, and gcd(p, q) = 1 (p and q are coprime).\nSquaring both sides, 2 = p²/q².\nThus, 2q² = p². Since 2q² is even, p² is even.\nIf p² is even, then p is even.\nSince p is even, there exists an integer k such that p = 2k.\nSubstituting into 2q² = p², we get 2q² = (2k)² = 4k².\nDividing by 2, q² = 2k². Since 2k² is even, q² is even.\nIf q² is even, then q is even.\nSince both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our assumption that gcd(p, q) = 1.\nTherefore, our initial assumption that √2 is rational must be false. Hence, √2 is irrational.\n",

This means p/q is in its simplest form.\n\n3. **Equation Formation and Deduction about p²:** If √2 = p/q, then squaring both sides gives 2 = p²/q². Multiplying both sides by q² yields 2q² = p². Since 2q² is even (because it is a multiple of 2), p² is even.\n\n4. **Deduction about p:** If p² is even, then p must also be even. If p were odd, then p could be written as 2k+1 for some integer k. Then p² = (2k+1)² = 4k² + 4k + 1 = 2(2k² + 2k) + 1, which is odd. Since we know p² is even, p must be even.\n\n5. **Expressing p as 2k:** Since p is even, there exists an integer k such that p = 2k.\n\n6. **Substitution:** Substitute p = 2k back into the equation 2q² = p². This gives us 2q² = (2k)² = 4k².\n\n7. **Simplification and Deduction about q²:** Divide both sides of the equation 2q² = 4k² by 2 to get q² = 2k². Since 2k² is even (because it is a multiple of 2), q² is even.\n\n8. **Deduction about q:** If q² is even, then q must also be even (using the same logic as in step 4).\n\n9. **Contradiction:** We have now shown that both p and q are even. This means that p and q have a common factor of 2, i.e., gcd(p, q) ≥ 2. However, this contradicts our initial assumption in step 2 that gcd(p, q) = 1.\n\n10. **Conclusion:** Since our initial assumption leads to a contradiction, the assumption must be false. Therefore, the square root of 2 is irrational.\n\nREFINED_ANSWER:\nAssume √2 is rational. Then there exist integers p and q, q ≠ 0, such that √2 = p/q, and gcd(p, q) = 1 (p and q are coprime).\nSquaring both sides, 2 = p²/q².\nThus, 2q² = p². Since 2q² is even, p² is even.\nIf p² is even, then p is even.\nSince p is even, there exists an integer k such that p = 2k.\nSubstituting into 2q² = p², we get 2q² = (2k)² = 4k².\nDividing by 2, q² = 2k². Since 2k² is even, q² is even.\nIf q² is even, then q is even.\nSince both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our assumption that gcd(p, q) = 1.\nTherefore, our initial assumption that √2 is rational must be false. Hence, √2 is irrational.\n\nCONFIDENCE:\n1.0\n",

          "review": "Okay, let's analyze the provided solution for proving the irrationality of the square root of 2 using proof by contradiction.\n\n**STRENGTHS:**\n\n*   **Clear Structure:** The solution is well-structured and follows a logical progression, making it easy to follow the argument.\n*   **Correct Initial Assumption:** The initial assumption for contradiction is correctly stated.\n*   **Key Steps Identified:** The solution correctly identifies the key steps in the proof, such as the deductions about p and q being even.\n*   **Correct Contradiction:** The contradiction is correctly identified (p and q having a common factor of 2, contradicting the simplest form assumption).\n*   **Clear Conclusion:** The conclusion clearly states that the initial assumption is false, and therefore, the square root of 2 is irrational.\n*   **Formal Proof of Sub-Claim:** The inclusion of a formal proof for \"If p² is even, then p is even\" adds to the rigor.\n\n**WEAKNESSES:**\n\n*   **Lack of Formal Quantifiers:** The argument would be more rigorous with the explicit use of quantifiers (e.g., \"for all,\" \"there exists\") when defining integers and making deductions. While implicitly understood, making them explicit enhances clarity and precision.\n*   **Implicit Assumption about Integers:** The solution assumes that p and q are integers without explicitly stating that they belong to the set of integers (ℤ).\n\n**ERRORS:**\n\n*   **No significant errors detected.** The solution is logically sound and the steps are well-justified.\n\n**SUGGESTED_CHANGES:**\n\n1.  **Explicitly State Integer Membership:** When introducing p, q, and k, explicitly state that they belong to the set of integers (ℤ). For example: \"Let p, q ∈ ℤ, where q ≠ 0.\" and \"Let k ∈ ℤ.\"\n\n2.  **Add Quantifiers for Clarity (Optional but Recommended for Increased Rigor):** While not strictly necessary, adding quantifiers can improve the formal clarity of the argument. For example:\n\n    *   Instead of \"If p is even, we can express it as p = 2k,\" write: \"If p is even, then there exists an integer k ∈ ℤ such that p = 2k.\"\n    *   When saying p/q is in simplest form, one could add: \"There does not exist any integer d > 1, such that d divides both p and q.\"\n\n3.  **Reword the \"Simplest Form\" Assumption:** To make it even more mathematically precise, the assumption that p/q is in its simplest form could be rephrased as: \"Assume that p and q are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1, denoted gcd(p, q) = 1).\" This is mathematically equivalent but slightly more concise and standard.\n\nHere's an example of how incorporating the suggestions might look:\n\n\"Assume √2 is rational. Then √2 = p/q where p, q ∈ ℤ, q ≠ 0, and gcd(p, q) = 1 (i.e., p and q are coprime).\nSquaring both sides, 2 = p²/q².\nThus, 2q² = p².\nSince 2q² is even, p² is even.\nIf p² is even, then p is even (proof omitted, but can be included).\nSince p is even, there exists an integer k ∈ ℤ such that p = 2k.\nSubstituting into 2q² = p², we get 2q² = (2k)² = 4k².\nDividing by 2, q² = 2k².\nSince 2k² is even, q² is even.\nIf q² is even, then q is even (proof omitted, but can be included).\nSince both p and q are even, they have a common factor of 2. This contradicts our assumption that gcd(p, q) = 1.\nTherefore, our initial assumption that √2 is rational must be false. Hence, √2 is irrational.\"\n\n**OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:**\n\nsound_solution. The solution is logically correct and provides a valid proof by contradiction. The suggested changes are primarily for enhancing mathematical rigor and clarity, rather than correcting errors.\n"
