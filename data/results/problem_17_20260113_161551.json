Let A' be the complement of A, i.e., the event of not getting any 6s in 4 rolls.\n\nWe assume the die is fair, meaning that the probability of rolling any specific number from 1 to 6 is equal, i.e., P(rolling a 1) = P(rolling a 2) = P(rolling a 3) = P(rolling a 4) = P(rolling a 5) = P(rolling a 6) = 1/6. Therefore, the probability of not rolling a 6 on a single roll is P(not rolling a 6) = 1 - P(rolling a 6) = 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.\n\nSince the die rolls are independent events (the outcome of one roll does not affect the outcome of any other roll), the probability of A' (not getting a 6 in any of the 4 rolls) is the product of the probabilities of not getting a 6 on each individual roll. This is due to the multiplication rule for independent events: P(A' and B' and C' and D') = P(A') * P(B') * P(C') * P(D'), where A', B', C', and D' are the events of not rolling a 6 on the first, second, third, and fourth rolls respectively.\n\nTherefore, P(A') = (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) * (5/6) = (5/6)^4 = 625/1296.\n\nThe probability of getting at least one 6 in 4 rolls is P(A) = 1 - P(A') = 1 - (625/1296) = (1296 - 625) / 1296 = 671/1296.\n\nREFINED_ANSWER:\n671/1296\n\nCONFIDENCE:\n1\n",

We assume the die is fair, which means P(rolling a 1) = P(rolling a 2) = P(rolling a 3) = P(rolling a 4) = P(rolling a 5) = P(rolling a 6) = 1/6.  Therefore, the probability of not rolling a 6 on a single roll is P(not rolling a 6) = 1 - P(rolling a 6) = 1 - (1/6) = 5/6.\n\n    Since the die rolls are independent, the probability of A' (not getting a 6 in any of the 4 rolls) is the product of the probabilities of not getting a 6 on each individual roll.
