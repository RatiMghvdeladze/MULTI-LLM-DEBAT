  "judgment": "ANALYSIS:\nAll three solvers correctly identify the core concept: a door is open if its number is a perfect square. They all arrive at the correct final answer. However, they differ in their level of explanation and rigor.\n\nSolver 1 provides a good intuitive explanation, focusing on the pairing of divisors and how perfect squares have an unpaired divisor (the square root). It's relatively concise and easy to understand.\n\nSolver 2 builds on this by adding a more formal justification for why a number has an odd number of divisors if and only if it's a perfect square. It also explicitly states the initial condition (all doors closed).\n\nSolver 3 is the most rigorous. It breaks down the solution into steps, provides a formal proof for the key concept (odd number of divisors implies perfect square), and generalizes the solution for any number of doors *N*. It also explicitly justifies why the number of toggles equals the number of divisors.\n\nWhile all are correct, Solver 3 is the most complete and logically sound.\n\nWINNER:\nSolver_3\n\nREASONING:\nSolver 3 is the best solution because it provides the most complete and rigorous explanation.

      "original": "REASONING:\n\nLet's denote the state of the $i$-th door after $n$ passes as $D(i, n)$, where $D(i, n) = 1$ if the door is open and $D(i, n) = 0$ if the door is closed. Initially, all doors are closed, so $D(i, 0) = 0$ for all $i$ from 1 to 100.\n\nA door is toggled on the $k$-th pass if $k$ is a divisor of the door number $i$. For example, door number 12 is toggled on passes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. After 100 passes, the state of the $i$-th door will be determined by the number of divisors of $i$. If $i$ has an odd number of divisors, the door will be open. If $i$ has an even number of divisors, the door will be closed.\n\nMost numbers have an even number of divisors because divisors usually come in pairs. For example, the divisors of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4). However, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. For example, the divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The divisor 3 is paired with itself (3 x 3 = 9), so it only counts once.\n\nTherefore, the doors that are open after 100 passes are the doors whose numbers are perfect squares. We need to find the perfect squares between 1 and 100 inclusive.\n\n$1^2 = 1$\n$2^2 = 4$\n$3^2 = 9$\n$4^2 = 16$\n$5^2 = 25$\n$6^2 = 36$\n$7^2 = 49$\n$8^2 = 64$\n$9^2 = 81$\n$10^2 = 100$\n$11^2 = 121 > 100$\n\nSo the perfect squares between 1 and 100 are 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

A door is toggled (changed from open to closed or vice versa) on pass number *k* if *k* is a divisor of the door number. For example, door number 12 is toggled on passes 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. After 100 passes, the final state of each door (open or closed) depends on how many times it has been toggled.\n\nIf a door has been toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. If it has been toggled an even number of times, it will be closed. The number of times a door is toggled is equal to the number of divisors of its door number.\n\nMost numbers have an even number of divisors because divisors usually come in pairs. For example, the divisors of 12 are (1, 12), (2, 6), and (3, 4). However, perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. For example, the divisors of 9 are 1, 3, and 9. The divisor 3 is paired with itself (3 x 3 = 9), so it only counts once.

In this case, the divisor sqrt(*n*) is paired with itself and is only counted once, resulting in an odd number of divisors.

If *n* is not a perfect square, then for every divisor *d* of *n*, *d* ≠ *n/d*.  Therefore, the divisors can be grouped into pairs *(d, n/d)*.  This implies that the total number of divisors must be even, which contradicts the assumption that *n* has an odd number of divisors. Therefore, *n* must be a perfect square.\n\n3.  **Generalize the Result:**\n    *   State: \"For any number of doors *N*, the doors that will be open are those whose numbers are perfect squares less than or equal to *N*.\"\n\n4.  **Restructure the Solution for Clarity:**\n    *   **Step 1:** State the problem and introduce the notation.\n    *   **Step 2:** Prove the number of toggles equals the number of divisors.\n    *   **Step 3:** Prove the number of divisors is odd if and only if the number is a perfect square.\n    *   **Step 4:** Apply the result to the specific case of 100 doors.\n\n**OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:**\n\npromising_but_flawed. The solution has the correct intuition and arrives at the correct answer. However, it lacks the mathematical rigor required for a complete and convincing proof. The missing proofs are essential to elevate the solution from an intuitive explanation to a mathematically sound argument.\n"
