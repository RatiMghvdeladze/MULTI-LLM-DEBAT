In this case, n = 100, a_1 = 1, and a_n = 100.  So, S_100 = 100(1 + 100)/2 = 100(101)/2 = 5050.\n\n2. **Find the sum of all integers from 1 to 100 that are divisible by 3:** The integers divisible by 3 are 3, 6, 9, ..., 99.  This is also an arithmetic series.  To find the number of terms, we divide the last term by 3: 99/3 = 33. So there are 33 terms.  The first term is 3, and the last term is 99.  Using the same formula, the sum is S_33 = 33(3 + 99)/2 = 33(102)/2 = 33(51) = 1683.\n\n3. **Subtract the sum of integers divisible by 3 from the total sum:** To find the sum of integers not divisible by 3, we subtract the sum of integers divisible by 3 from the sum of all integers from 1 to 100: 5050 - 1683 = 3367.\n\nANSWER:\n3367\n\nCONFIDENCE:\n1\n",

There might be a more insightful approach.\n\n**ERRORS:**\n\n*   **No actual errors in calculation or logic:** The solution arrives at the correct answer.\n\n**SUGGESTED_CHANGES:**\n\n*   **Consider a more modular arithmetic approach:** While not strictly necessary since the arithmetic series method works, exploring a modular arithmetic approach could offer a different perspective. For example, consider grouping the numbers 1 to 99 into sets of three: (1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), ... (97, 98, 99). In each group, only 1 and 2 are not divisible by 3. So, the sum of numbers not divisible by 3 from 1 to 99 would be (1+2) + (4+5) + ... + (97+98). We can also express this as 3 + 9 + ... + 195. This is a sum of an arithmetic series with the first term being 3, common difference 6 and number of terms being 33. Using the formula, sum = 33/2(2*3 + (33-1)*6) = 33/2(6 + 192) = 33/2 * 198 = 33 * 99 = 3267. Now we need to add 100 since 100 is not divisible by 3. The final sum would be 3267 + 100 = 3367.\n\n**OVERALL_ASSESSMENT:**\n\nsound_solution\n"
